# FCUI
Pool of bridge fragility curves
The FCUI short for Fragility Curve User Interface is written to facilitate the access to the dataset of already developed fragility parameters for different bridge classes in US. This way, the uncertainties corresponds to different fragility parameters, for a given bridge classification, can be addressed and utilized in estimating the level of damage for bridges in a community. 

-**Outputs**:
The outcome of this user interface are,
- Fragility parameters for the selected bridge classes
- Data for the plotted fragility curves
- Fragility parameter range for multiple bridge selections to randomly generate desired parameters

-**Updates**:
 The data and the code will be updated overtime, and any suggestions to make it more user-friendly and comprehensive is appreciated.
 
-**Awards**:
U.S. Geological Survey under Grant No. G19AP00055
